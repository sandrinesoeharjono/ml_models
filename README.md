# Machine Learning Models
Examples of ML model applications created in Python. Each use case has its own folder:
- **image_classification**: Use images of cats and dogs to train a binary image classifier using the Keras library.
- **neural network**: Use transcriptomic data from 30 breast cancer samples to feed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
